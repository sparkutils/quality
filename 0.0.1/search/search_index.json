The default type is Long / Bigint, you will have to provide the types directly when using something else. By default the placeholders are assumed to be nullable (i.e. true), you can use false to state the field should not be null. _lambda_ \u00b6 _lambda_( user function ) extracts the Spark LambdaFunction from a resolved user function, this must have the correct types expected by the Spark HigherOrderFunction they are parameters for. This allows using user defined functions and lambdas with in-built Spark HigherOrderFunctions aggExpr \u00b6 aggExpr( [ddl sum type], filter, sum, result) aggregates on rows which match the filter expression using the sum expression to aggregate then processes the results using the result expression. You can run multiple aggExpr's in a single pass select, use the first parameter to thread DDL type information through to the sum and result functions. bigBloom \u00b6 bigBloom(buildFrom, expectedSize, expectedFPP, 'bloom_id') creates an aggregated bloom filter using the buildFrom expression. The blooms are stored on a shared filesystem using the bloom_id, they can scale to high numbers of items whilst keeping the FPP (e.g. millions at 0.01 would imply 99% probability, you may have to cast to double in Spark 3.2). buildFrom can be driven by digestToLongs or hashWith functions when using multiple fields. callFun \u00b6 callFun( user function lambda variable, param1, param2, \u2026 paramN ) used within a lambda function it allows calling a lambda variable that contains a user function. Used from the top level sql it performs a similar function expecting either a full user function or a partially applied function, typically returned from another lambda user function. coalesceIfAttributesMissing \u00b6 coalesceIfAttributesMissing(expr, replaceWith) substitutes expr with the replaceWith expression when expr has missing attributes in the source dataframe. Your code must call the scala processIfAttributeMissing function before using in validate or ruleEngineRunner/ruleRunner: val missingAttributesAreReplacedRS = processIfAttributeMissing ( rs , struct ) val ( errors , _ ) = validate ( struct , missingAttributesAreReplacedRS ) // use it missingAttributesAreReplacedRS in your dataframe.. coalesceIfAttributesMissingDisable \u00b6 coalesceIfAttributesMissingDisable(expr) substitutes expr with the DisabledRule Integer result (-2) when expr has missing attributes in the source dataframe. Your code must call the scala processIfAttributeMissing function before using in validate or ruleEngineRunner/ruleRunner: val missingAttributesAreReplacedRS = processIfAttributeMissing ( rs , struct ) val ( errors , _ ) = validate ( struct , missingAttributesAreReplacedRS ) // use it missingAttributesAreReplacedRS in your dataframe.. digestToLongs \u00b6 digestToLongs('digestImpl', fields*) creates an array of longs based on creating the given MessageDigest impl. A 128-bit impl will generate two longs from it's digest digestToLongsStruct \u00b6 digestToLongsStruct('digestImpl', fields*) creates structure of longs with i0 to iN named fields based on creating the given MessageDigest impl. disabledRule \u00b6 disabledRule() returns the DisabledRule Integer result (-2) for use in filtering and to disable rules (which may not signify a version bump) failed \u00b6 failed() returns the Failed Integer result (0) for use in filtering fieldBasedID \u00b6 fieldBasedID('prefix', 'digestImpl', fields*) creates a variable bit length id by using a given MessageDigest impl over the fields, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _iN fields in the resulting structure flattenResults \u00b6 flattenResults(dataQualityExpr) expands data quality results into a flat array flattenRuleResults \u00b6 flattenRuleResults(dataQualityExpr) expands data quality results into a structure of flattenedResults, salientRule (the one used to create the output) and the rule result. salientRule will be null if there was no matching rule hashFieldBasedID \u00b6 hashFieldBasedID('prefix', 'digestImpl', fields*) creates a variable bit length id by using a given Guava Hasher impl over the fields, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _iN fields in the resulting structure hashWith \u00b6 hashWith('HASH', fields*) Generates a hash value (array of longs) suitable for using in blooms based on the given Guava hash implementation. Note based on testing the digestToLongs function for SHA256 and MD5 are faster. Valid hashes: MURMUR3_32, MURMUR3_128, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, ADLER32, CRC32, SIPHASH24. When an invalid HASH name is provided MURMUR3_128 will be chosen. Open source Spark 3.1.2 issues On Spark 3.1.2 open source this may get resolver errors due to a downgrade on guava version - 15.0 is used on Databricks, open source 3.0.3 uses 16.0.1, 3.1.2 drops this to 11 and misses crc32, sipHash24 and adler32. hashWithStruct \u00b6 per hashWith('HASH', fields*) but generates a struct with i0 to ix named longs. This structure is not suitable for blooms idEqual \u00b6 idEqual(leftPrefix, rightPrefix) takes two prefixes which will be used to match leftPrefix_base = rightPrefix_base, i0 and i1 fields. It does not currently support more than two i's inc \u00b6 inc() increments the current sum by 1 Alternatives: inc( x ) use an expression of type Long to increment longPair \u00b6 longPair(lower, higher) creates a structure with these lower and higher longs longPairEqual \u00b6 longPairEqual(leftPrefix, rightPrefix) takes two prefixes which will be used to match leftPrefix_lower = rightPrefix_lower and leftPrefix_higher = rightPrefix_higher longPairFromUUID \u00b6 longPairFromUUID(expr) converts a UUID to a structure with lower and higher longs mapContains \u00b6 mapContains(expr, 'mapid') returns true if there is an item in the map mapLookup \u00b6 mapLookup(expr, 'mapid') returns either the lookup in map specified by mapid or null meanF \u00b6 meanF() simple mean on the results, expecting sum and count type Long murmur3ID \u00b6 murmur3ID('prefix', fields*) Generates a 160bit id using murmer3 hashing over input fields, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _i1 fields in the resulting structure packInts \u00b6 packInts(lower, higher) a packaged long from two ints, used within result compression passed \u00b6 passed() returns the Passed Integer for use in filtering: 10000 prefixedToLongPair \u00b6 prefixedToLongPair('prefix', field) converts a 128bit longpair field with the given prefix into a higher and lower long pair without prefix. This is suitable for converting provided id's into uuids for example via a further call to rngUUID. printCode \u00b6 printCode( [msg], expr ) prints the code generated by an expression, the value variable and the isNull variable and forwards eval calls / type etc. to the expression. The code is printed once per partition on the executors std. output. You will have to check each executor to find the used nodes output. To use with unit testing on a single host you may overwrite the writer function in registerQualityFunctions, you should however use a top level object and var to write into (or stream), printCode will not be able to write to std out properly (spark redirects / captures stdout) or non top level objects (due to classloader / function instance issues). Testing on other hosts without using stdout should do so to a shared file location or similar. !!! \"information\" It is not compatible with every expression Aggregate expressions like aggExpr or sum etc. won't generate code so they aren't compatible with printCode. \\_lambda\\_ is also incompatible with printCode both wrapping a user function and the \\_lambda\\_ function. Similarly the \\_() placeholder function cannot be wrapped. Any function expecting a specific signature like aggExpr or other HigherOrderFunctions like aggregate or filter are unlikely to support wrapped arguements. printExpr \u00b6 printExpr( [msg], expr ) prints the expression tree via toString with an optional msg The message is printed to the driver nodes std. output, often shown in notebooks as well. To use with unit testing you may overwrite the writer function in registerQualityFunctions, you should however use a top level object and var to write into (or stream). probability \u00b6 probability(expr) will translate probability rule results into a double, e.g. 1000 returns 0.01. This is useful for interpreting and filtering on probability based results: 0 -> 10000 non-inclusive probabilityIn \u00b6 probabilityIn(expr, 'bloomid') returns the probability of the expr being in the bloomfilter specified by bloomid. This function either returns 0.0, where it is definitely not present, or the original FPP where it may be present. You may use digestToLongs or hashWith as appropriate to use multiple columns safely. providedID \u00b6 providedID('prefix', existingLongs) creates an id for an existing array of longs, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _iN fields in the resulting structure resultsWith \u00b6 resultsWith( x ) process results lambda x (e.g. (sum, count) -> sum ) that takes sum from the aggregate, count from the number of rows counted. Defaults both the sumtype and counttype as LongType Alternatives: resultsWith( [sum ddl type], x) Use the given ddl type for the sum type e.g. 'MAP<STRING, DOUBLE>' resultsWith( [sum ddl type], [result ddl type], x) Use the given ddl type for the sum and result types returnSum \u00b6 returnSum( sum type ddl ) just returns the sum and ignores the count param, expands to resultsWith( [sum ddl_type], (sum, count) -> sum) rng \u00b6 rng() Generates a 128bit random id using XO_RO_SHI_RO_128_PP, encoded as a lower and higher long pair Alternatives: rng('algorithm') Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG rng('algorithm', seedL) Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG with a long seed rngBytes \u00b6 rngBytes() Generates a 128bit random id using XO_RO_SHI_RO_128_PP, encoded as a byte array Alternatives: rngBytes('algorithm') Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG rngBytes('algorithm', seedL) Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG with a long seed rngBytes('algorithm', seedL, byteCount) Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG with a long seed, with a specific byte length integer (e.g. 16 is two longs, 8 is integer) rngID \u00b6 rngID('prefix') Generates a 160bit random id using XO_RO_SHI_RO_128_PP, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _i1 fields in the resulting structure Alternatives: rngId('prefix', 'algorithm') Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG, using other algorithm's may generate more long _iN fields rngId('prefix', 'algorithm', seedL) Uses Commons RNG RandomSource to implement the RNG with a long seed, using other algorithm's may generate more long _iN fields rngUUID \u00b6 rngUUID(expr) takes either a structure with lower and higher longs or a 128bit binary type and converts to a string uuid ruleSuiteResultDetails \u00b6 ruleSuiteResultDetails(dq) strips the overallResult from the dataquality results, suitable for keeping overall result as a top-level field with associated performance improvements saferLongPair \u00b6 deprecated use uniqueId - saferLongPair(expr, 'bloomid') Prefer to use uniqueID, this 'safer' rng repeatedly calls the expr rng function until there is no matching entry in the bloom id. It returns lower and higher longs. smallBloom \u00b6 smallBloom(buildFrom, expectedSize, expectedFPP) creates a simply bytearray bloom filter using the expected size and fpp - 0.01 is 99%, you may have to cast to double in Spark 3.2. buildFrom can be driven by digestToLongs or hashWith functions when using multiple fields. softFail \u00b6 softFail(ruleexpr) will treat any rule failure (e.g. failed() ) as returning softFailed() softFailed \u00b6 softFailed() returns the SoftFailed Integer result (-1) for use in filtering sumWith \u00b6 sumWith( x ) adds expression x for each row processed in an aggExpr with a default of LongType Alternatives: sumWith( [ddl type], x) Use the given ddl type e.g. 'MAP<STRING, DOUBLE>' uniqueID \u00b6 uniqueID('prefix') Generates a 160bit guaranteed unique id (requires MAC address uniqueness) with contiguous higher values within a partition and overflow with timestamp ms., prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _i1 fields in the resulting structure unpack \u00b6 unpack(expr) takes a packed rule long and unpacks it to a .id and .version structure unpackIdTriple \u00b6 unpackIdTriple(expr) takes a packed rule triple of longs (ruleSuiteId, ruleSetId and ruleId) and unpacks it to (ruleSuiteId, ruleSuiteVersion, ruleSetId, ruleSetVersion, ruleId, ruleVersion) updateField \u00b6 updateField(structure_expr, 'field.subfield', replaceWith, 'fieldN', replaceWithN) processes structures allowing you to replace sub items (think lens in functional programming) using the structure fields path name. This is wrapped and almost verbatim version of Make Structs Easier' AddFields zaFieldBasedID \u00b6 zaFieldBasedID('prefix', 'digestImpl', fields*) creates a 64bit id (96bit including header) by using a given Zero Allocation impl over the fields, prefix is used with the _base and _i0 fields in the resulting structure. Prefer using the zaLongsFieldBasedID for less collisions zaHashLongsWith \u00b6 zaHashLongsWith('HASH', fields*) generates a multi length long array but with a zero allocation implementation . This structure is suitable for blooms, the default XXH3 algorithm is the 128bit version of that used by the internal bigBloom implementation. Available HASH functions are MURMUR3_128, XXH3 zaHashLongsWithStruct \u00b6 similar to zaHashLongsWith('HASH', fields*) but generates an ID relevant multi length long struct, which is not suitable for blooms zaHashWith \u00b6 zaHashWith('HASH', fields*) generates a single length long array always with 64 bits but with a zero allocation implementation . This structure is suitable for blooms, the default XX algorithm is used by the internal bigBloom implementation. Available HASH functions are MURMUR3_64, CITY_1_1, FARMNA, FARMOU, METRO, WY_V3, XX zaHashWithStruct \u00b6 similar to zaHashWith('HASH', fields*) but generates an ID relevant multi length long struct (of one long), which is not suitable for blooms. Prefer zaHashLongsWithStruct for reduced collisions with either the MURMUR3_128 or XXH3 versions of hashes zaLongsFieldBasedID \u00b6 zaLongsFieldBasedID('prefix', 'digestImpl', fields*) creates a variable length id by using a given Zero Allocation impl over the fields, prefix is used with the _base, _i0 and _iN fields in the resulting structure.

This function guarantees that if an item is not in the bloom filter it will return false, however if it returns true this is to a probability defined by the FPP value. In contrast to a Set which requires the items (or at least their hash values) to be stored individually blooms make use of multiple blocks and apply bit setting based on hashes of the input value over some function. These resulting blocks and bitsets are far smaller in memory and storage usage than a typical set. For example it's possible to store hundreds of millions of items within a bloom and still keep withn a normal Java byte array boundary. This act of using bit flipping also allows blooms to be or'd for the same size and FPP, which is great for aggregation functions in Spark. Whilst blooms are great the guarantees break when: The number of items far exceeds the initial size used to create the bloom - false is still guaranteed to not be present but the true value will no longer represent FPP, the bloom has degraded The number of bits required to store the initial number of items at the FPP exceed what can be represented by the bloom algorithm. If you attempt to store billions of items within a bloom at a high FPP you will quickly fall foul of 2, and this is easily done with both the Spark stats.package and the current bloom filters on Databricks. This makes them next to useless for large dataset lookups on typical bloom implementations. How does Quality change this? \u00b6 It can't change the fundemental laws of bloom filters, if you use the number of bits up your bloom filter is next to useless. You can however add multiple Java byte arrays and bucket the hashes across them. This works great up to about 1.5b items in a typical aggregation function within Spark, however Spark only allows a maximum of 2Gb for an InternalRow - of which aggregates are stored in. Quality provides three bloom implementations the Spark stats package, small - which buckets within an InternalRow (1.2-1.5b items max whilst maintaining FPP) - and big which doesn't use Spark aggregations to store the results of aggregations but rather a shared file system such as Databricks dbfs. Both the small and big bloom functions use Parquet's bloom filter implementation which both significantly faster and has better statistical properties than Sparks/Guavas or Breezes.

The ruleEngineRunner function however allows you to take an action based on the passing of a rule and, via salience, choose the most appropriate output for a given row. You can understand QualityRules as a large scale auditable SQL case statement with \"when\" being the trigger rule and the \"then\" as the output expression. RuleSuites are built per the normal DQ rules however a RuleResultProcessor is supplied: val ruleResultProcessor = RunOnPassProcessor ( salience , Id ( outputId , outputVersion ), RuleLogicUtils . expr ( \"array(account_row('from', account), account_row('to', 'other_account1'))\" ))) val rule = Rule ( Id ( id , version ), expressionRule , ruleResultProcessor ) val ruleSuite = RuleSuite ( Id ( ruleSuiteId , ruleSuiteVersion ), Seq ( RuleSet ( Id ( ruleSetId , ruleSetVersion ), Seq ( rule ) ))) val rer = ruleEngineRunner ( ruleSuite , DataType . fromDDL ( \"ARRAY<STRUCT<`transfer_type`: STRING, `account`: STRING>>\" )) val testDataDF = ... val outdf = testDataDF . withColumn ( \"together\" , rer ). selectExpr ( \"*\" , \"together.result\" ) The ruleEngineRunner takes a DataType parameter that must describe the type of the result column type. An additional salientRule column is available that packs three the Id's that represent the ruleId chosen by salience. If this is null then no rule was triggered and the output column will also be null (verifiable via debug mode), if however there is an entry but the output is null then this signifies that the output expression produced a null. The salientRule column may be pulled apart down to the id number and versions via the unpack expression or unpackIdTriple to unpack the lot in one go. If you are using frameless encoders these longs can be converted to a triple of Id's. The salience parameter to the RunOnPassProcessor is used to ensure the lowest value is returned for a ruleSuite. It is the responsibility of the rule configuration to ensure there can only be one output. All of the existing functionality, lambadas etc. can be used to customise the results and, as per the normal DQ processing, is run in-process across the clusters when the spark action is taken (like writing the dataframe to disk). Serializing \u00b6 The serializing approach uses the same functions as normal DQ RuleSuites, the only difference is you should use toDS and provide the two additional ruleEngine parameters when reading from a DF: val withoutLambdasAndOutputExpressions = readRulesFromDF ( rulesDF , col ( \"ruleSuiteId\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleSetId\" ), col ( \"ruleSetVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleId\" ), col ( \"ruleVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleExpr\" ), col ( \"ruleEngineSalience\" ), col ( \"ruleEngineId\" ), col ( \"ruleEngineVersion\" ) ) val lambdas = ... val outputExpressions = readOutputExpressionsFromDF ( so . toDF (), col ( \"ruleExpr\" ), col ( \"functionId\" ), col ( \"functionVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteId\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteVersion\" ) ) val ( ruleMap , missing ) = integrateOutputExpressions ( withoutLambdasAndOutputExpressions , outputExpressions ) The ruleExpr is only run for the lowest ruleEngineSalience result of any passing ruleExpr. The missing result will contain any output expressions specified by a rule which do not exist in the output expression dataframe based by rulesuite id, if your rulesuite id is not present in the missing entries your RuleSuite is good to go. The rest of the serialization functions to combine lambdas etc. work as per normal DQ rules allowing you to use lambda functions in your QualityRules output rules as well. The result of toDS will contain the three ruleEngine fields, you can simply drop them if they are not needed. Debugging \u00b6 The RuleResult's indicate if a rule has not triggered but in the case of multiple matching rules it can be useful to see which rules would have been chosen. To enable this you can add the debugMode parameter to the ruleEngineRunner: val rer = ruleEngineRunner ( ruleSuite , DataType . fromDDL ( \"ARRAY<STRUCT<`transfer_type`: STRING, `account`: STRING>>\" ), debugMode = true ) This changes the output column 'result' field type to: ARRAY < STRUCT <` salience ` : INTEGER , ` result ` : ARRAY < ORIGINGALRESULTTYPE >> Why do I have a null There are two cases where you may get a null result: no rules have matched (you can verify this as you'll have no passed() rules). your rule actually returned a null (you can verify this by putting on debug mode, you'll see a salience but no result) flattenRuleResults \u00b6 val outdf = testDataDF . withColumn ( \"together\" , rer ). selectExpr ( \"explode(flattenRuleResults(together)) as expl\" ). selectExpr ( \"expl.*\" ) This sql function behaves the same way as per flattenResults, however there are now two structures to 'explode'. debugRules works as expected here as well. resolveWith \u00b6 Use with care - very experimental The resolveWith functionality has several issues with Spark compatibility which may lead to code failing when it looks like it should work. Known issues: Using filter then count will stop necessary attributes being produced for resolving, Spark optimises them out as count doesn't need them, however the rules definitely do need some attributes to be useful. You may not select different attributes, remove any, re-order them, or add extra attributes, this is likely to cause failure in show'ing or write'ing Spark is free to optimise other actions than just count, ymmv in which ones work. resolveWith attempts to improve performance of planning for general spark operations by first using a reduced plan against the source dataframe. The resulting Expression will have all functions and attributes resolved and is hidden from further processing by Spark until your rules actually run. val testDataDF = .... val rer = ruleEngineRunner ( ruleSuite , DataType . fromDDL ( DDL ), debugMode = debugMode , resolveWith = resolveWith = Some ( testDataDF )) val withRules = rer . withColumn ( \"ruleResults\" , rer ) // ... use the rules Why is this needed? \u00b6 For RuleSuites with 1000s of triggers the effort for Spark to prepare the rules is significant. In tests 1k rule with 50 field evalutaions is already sufficient to cause a delay of over 1m for each action (show, write, count etc.) and the size of the data being processed is not relevant. After building the action QualityRules scale and perform as expected, but that initial costs of 1m per action is significant as it can only be improved by higher spec drivers. resolveWith, if it works for given use case, drastically reduces this cost, the above 1k example is a 30s evaluation up front and far less cost for each further action. With the rather horrible 1k rule example the clock time of running 1k rows through 1k rules with a simple show, then count and write for actions was 6m15s on an Azure b4ms, using resolveWith brings this down to 1m30s for the same actions. Still not blazingly fast of course, but far more tolerable and becomes suitable for smaller batch jobs. Any reason why I shouldn't try it? \u00b6 Not really but for production use cases where your trigger and output rules complexity is low you should prefer to not use it, it's likely fast enough and this solution is very much experimental. You definitely shouldn't use it when using relation or table fields in your expressions e.g. table.field this does not work (verify this by running JoinValidationTest using evalCodeGens instead of evalCodeGensNoResolve).

This works by breaking out the nested structure of a RuleSuite into multiple index, salience and id arrays which are fixed for the duration of an action. Whilst this reduces the overhead of array and temporary structure creation the compilation also unrolls the evaluation of trigger rules allowing jit optimisations to kick in.

In contrast to ruleEngineRunner, which uses salience to select which output expression to run, ruleFolderRunner uses salience to order the execution of each matching output expression. To facilitate this OutputExpressions in the ruleFolderRunner must be lambdas with one parameter. ruleFolderRunner takes a starter Column, which is evaluated against the row and then is passed as the parameter to the OutputExpression lambdas, in turn the result of these output lambdas is then fed in to the next matching OutputExpression and folded over until the last is run, which is returned. When using debugMode you get the salience and each output returned in the resulting array, as with ruleEngineRunner the Encoder derivations for RuleFolderResult work with both T and Seq[(Int, T)] where the Int is salience. RuleSuites are built per the normal DQ rules however a RuleResultProcessor is supplied with Lambda OutputExpressions: val ruleResultProcessor = RunOnPassProcessor ( salience , Id ( outputId , outputVersion ), RuleLogicUtils . expr ( \"thecurrent -> updateField(thecurrent, 'account', concat(thecurrent.account, '_suffix') )\" ))) val rule = Rule ( Id ( id , version ), expressionRule , ruleResultProcessor ) val ruleSuite = RuleSuite ( Id ( ruleSuiteId , ruleSuiteVersion ), Seq ( RuleSet ( Id ( ruleSetId , ruleSetVersion ), Seq ( rule ) ))) val rer = ruleFolderRunner ( ruleSuite , struct ( $ \"transfer_type\" , $ \"account\" )) val testDataDF = ... val outdf = testDataDF . withColumn ( \"together\" , rer ). selectExpr ( \"*\" , \"together.result\" ) You may use multiple path, expression combinations, to change multiple fields at once - this will be faster than nesting results.

Note Whilst you are free to add lambdas when not using a RuleSuite the library will not ensure that only functions registered as part of a RuleSuite are used in rules, such hygiene is necessarily left to the user. LambdaFunctions may have any number of parameters e.g. given a greaterThan lambda: ( param1 , param2 ) -> param1 > param2 you would be able to call it with two expressions greaterThan ( col1 , col2 ) Single argument lambdas should not use brackets around the parameters and zero argument lambdas use no input or ->. In all cases the lambda can use the attributes from the surrounding dataframe - it's effectively global, you cannot use variables from surrounding / calling lambdas. Don't use 'current'\u2026 as a lambda variable name on 2.4 Bizarrely this causes the parser to fail on 2.4 only, no more recent version suffers this. Same goes for left or right as names. What about default parameter or different length parameter length Lambdas? \u00b6 To define multiple parameter length lambdas just define new lambdas with the same name but different argument lengths. You can freely call the same lambda name with different parameters e.g.: val rule = LambdaFunction ( \"multValCCY\" , \"multValCCY(value, ccyrate)\" , Id ( 1 , 2 )) val rule1 = LambdaFunction ( \"multValCCY\" , \"theValue -> multValCCY(theValue, ccyrate)\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) val rule2 = LambdaFunction ( \"multValCCY\" , \"(theValue, ccy) -> theValue * ccy\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( rule , rule1 , rule2 )) // all of these should work df . withColumn ( \"newcalc\" , expr ( \"multValCCY()\" )) df . withColumn ( \"newcalc\" , expr ( \"multValCCY(value)\" )) df . withColumn ( \"newcalc\" , expr ( \"multValCCY(value, ccyrate)\" )) Higher Order Functions \u00b6 As Lambda's in Spark aren't first class citizens you can neither partially apply them (fill in parameters to derive new lambdas) nor pass them into a lambda. In 0.7.1 Quality experimentally adds three new concepts to the mix: Placeholders - _ () - which represents a value which still needs to be filled (partial application) Application - callFun () - which, in a lambda, allows you to apply a function parameter Lambda Extraction - _lambda_ () - which allows Lambdas to be used with existing Spark HigherOrderFunctions (like aggregate ) Unfortunately the last piece of that puzzle of returning a higher order function isn't currently possible. Putting together 1 and 3 (straight out of the test suite): val plus = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 1 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus3\" , \"(a, b, c) -> a + b + c\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) val hof = LambdaFunction ( \"hof\" , \"func -> aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(func))\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus , plus3 , hof )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ // attempt to dropping a reference to a function where simple lambdas are expected. // control assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, (acc, x) -> acc + x) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // all params would be needed with multiple aritys assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(plus(_('int'), _('int')))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // can we play with partials? assert ( 21 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(plus3(_('int'), _('int'), 5))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // hof'd assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT hof(plus(_('int'), _('int'))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) In the above example you can see type's being specified to the placeholder function, this is needed because, similar to aggExpr, Spark can't know the types until after they are evaluated and resolved. This does have the benefit of keeping the types at the partial application site. The default placeholder type is Long / Bigint . The lambda function extracts a fully resolved underlying Spark LambdaFunction, which means the types must be correct as it is provided to the function (use the placeholder function to specify types). Similarly, you use the lambda function to extract the Spark LambdaFunction from a user provided parameter (as seen in the hof example). The aggregate function only accepts two parameters for its accumulator, but in the plus3 example we've 'injected' in a third. Partially applying the plus3 with the value 5 in it's \"c\" position leaves the two arguments as new function. Quality ensures the necessary transformations are done before it hits the aggregate expression. Great, but can I use it with aggExpr? Yep: select aggExpr ( 'DECIMAL(38,18)' , dec IS NOT NULL , myinc ( _ ()), myretsum ( _ (), _ ())) as agg allows you to define the myinc and myretsum elsewhere, you don't need to use the lambda function with aggExpr. What about application? Using callFun: val use = LambdaFunction ( \"use\" , \"(func, b) -> callFun(func, b)\" , Id ( 4 , 2 )) the first parameter must be the lambda variable referring to your function followed by the necessary parameters to pass in. Func in this case has a single parameter but of course it could have started with 5 and had 4 partially applied. Again you don't need to use lambda to pass the functions further down the line: val deep = LambdaFunction ( \"deep\" , \"(func, a, b) -> use(func, a, b)\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) Deep takes the function and simply passes it to use where the callFun exists. Finally you can also further partially apply your lambda variables: val plus2 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b, c) -> plus(plus(a, b), c)\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val papplyt = LambdaFunction ( \"papplyt\" , \"(func, a, b, c) -> callFun(callFun(func, _(), _(), c), a, b)\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus2 , plus3 , papplyt )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ assert ( 6L == sparkSession . sql ( \"select papplyt(plus(_(), _(), _()), 1L, 2L, 3L) as res\" ). as [ Long ]. head ) Here the callFun directly applies the function afterwards but you could equally pass it to other functions. callFun ( callFun ( func , _ (), _ (), c ), a , b ) can then be read as partially apply func (plus with 3 arguments) parameter 3 with the lambda variable c, creating a new two argument function. Then call that function with the a and b parameters. Useless in this case perhaps but it should be illustrative. All that's missing is returning lambdas: val plus2 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b, c) -> plus(plus(a, b), c)\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val retLambda = LambdaFunction ( \"retLambda\" , \"(a, b) -> plus(a, b, _())\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus2 , plus3 , retLambda )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ assert ( 6L == { val sql = sparkSession . sql ( \"select callFun(retLambda(1L, 2L), 3L) as res\" ) sql . as [ Long ]. head }) here the user function retLambda returns the plus with 3 arity applied over a and b, leaving a function of one arity to fill. The top level callFun then applies the last argument (c). The second test It is experimental Although behaviour has been tested with compilation and across the support DBRs it's entirely possible there are gaps in the trickery used. A good example of the experimental nature is the _() function, it's quite possible that is taken by Spark at a later stage. lambda drop in call arguments to transform_values and transform_keys don't work on 3.0 and 3.1.2 They pattern match on List and not seq, later versions fix this. To work around this you must explicitly use lambdas for these functions. Controlling compilation - Tweaking the Quality Optimisations \u00b6 Normal Spark LambdaFunctions, NamedLambdaVariable and HigherOrderFunctions aren't compiled, this is - in part - due to the nature of having to thread the lambda variables across the Expression tree and calling bind. At the time of codegen bind has already been called however so the code is free to create a new tree just for compilation. Quality makes use of this and replaces all NamedLambdaVariables expressions with a simple variable in the generated code. NamedLambdaVariables also use AtomicReferences, which was introduced to avoid a tree manipulation task - see here for the code introduction. AtomicReferences are slower for both writes and reads of non-contended variables. As such Quality does away with this in its compilation, the exprId is sufficient to track the actual id. Quality only attempts to replace it's own FunN and reverts to using NamedLambdaVariables if it encounters any other HigherOrderFunction. Where it can replace it uses NamedLambdaVariableCodeGen with an ExprId specific code snippet. You can customise this logic via implementing: trait LambdaCompilationHandler { /** * * @param expr * @return empty if the expression should be transformed (i.e. there is a custom solution for it). Otherwise return the full set of NamedLambdaVariables found */ def shouldTransform ( expr : Expression ): Seq [ NamedLambdaVariable ] /** * Transform the expression using the scope of replaceable named lambda variable expression * @param expr * @param scope * @return */ def transform ( expr : Expression , scope : Map [ ExprId , NamedLambdaVariableCodeGen ]): Expression } and supplying it via the environment variable, System.property or via sparkSession.sparkContext.setLocalProperty quality.lambdaHandlers using this format: name = className where name is either a fully qualified class name of a HigherOrderFunction or of a lambda (FunN) function. The default org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.DoCodegenFallbackHandler allows you to disable any optimisation for a HigherOrderFunction. It can be used to disable all FunN optimisations with: -Dquality.lambdaHandlers=org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.FunN=org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.DoCodegenFallbackHandler Alternatively if you have a hotspot with any inbuilt HoF such as array_transform, filter or transform_values you could replace the implementation for compilation with your own transformation. e.g.: -Dquality.lambdaHandlers=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.TransformValues=org.mine.SuperfastTransformValues Why do all this? \u00b6 Speed, it's up to 40% faster. LambdaRowPerfTest, in the test suite, generates an increasing number of lambdas and only runs over 10k rows but still sees clear benefits e.g. (orange is compiled lambdas): This difference is already noticeable with a small increment function in a folder: thecurrent -> updateField ( thecurrent , 'thecount' , thecurrent . thecount + 1 ) The difference is typically higher with nested lambdas. Should your compilation time exceed the execution time you may wish to disable compilation via the fallback handler.","title":"User Defined Functions"},{"location":"advanced/userFunctions/#what-about-default-parameter-or-different-length-parameter-length-lambdas","text":"To define multiple parameter length lambdas just define new lambdas with the same name but different argument lengths.

Putting together 1 and 3 (straight out of the test suite): val plus = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 1 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus3\" , \"(a, b, c) -> a + b + c\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) val hof = LambdaFunction ( \"hof\" , \"func -> aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(func))\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus , plus3 , hof )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ // attempt to dropping a reference to a function where simple lambdas are expected. // control assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, (acc, x) -> acc + x) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // all params would be needed with multiple aritys assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(plus(_('int'), _('int')))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // can we play with partials? assert ( 21 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT aggregate(array(1, 2, 3), 0, _lambda_(plus3(_('int'), _('int'), 5))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) // hof'd assert ( 6 == sparkSession . sql ( \"SELECT hof(plus(_('int'), _('int'))) as res\" ). as [ Int ]. head ) In the above example you can see type's being specified to the placeholder function, this is needed because, similar to aggExpr, Spark can't know the types until after they are evaluated and resolved. This does have the benefit of keeping the types at the partial application site. The default placeholder type is Long / Bigint . The lambda function extracts a fully resolved underlying Spark LambdaFunction, which means the types must be correct as it is provided to the function (use the placeholder function to specify types). Similarly, you use the lambda function to extract the Spark LambdaFunction from a user provided parameter (as seen in the hof example). The aggregate function only accepts two parameters for its accumulator, but in the plus3 example we've 'injected' in a third. Partially applying the plus3 with the value 5 in it's \"c\" position leaves the two arguments as new function. Quality ensures the necessary transformations are done before it hits the aggregate expression. Great, but can I use it with aggExpr? Yep: select aggExpr ( 'DECIMAL(38,18)' , dec IS NOT NULL , myinc ( _ ()), myretsum ( _ (), _ ())) as agg allows you to define the myinc and myretsum elsewhere, you don't need to use the lambda function with aggExpr. What about application? Using callFun: val use = LambdaFunction ( \"use\" , \"(func, b) -> callFun(func, b)\" , Id ( 4 , 2 )) the first parameter must be the lambda variable referring to your function followed by the necessary parameters to pass in. Func in this case has a single parameter but of course it could have started with 5 and had 4 partially applied. Again you don't need to use lambda to pass the functions further down the line: val deep = LambdaFunction ( \"deep\" , \"(func, a, b) -> use(func, a, b)\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) Deep takes the function and simply passes it to use where the callFun exists. Finally you can also further partially apply your lambda variables: val plus2 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b, c) -> plus(plus(a, b), c)\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val papplyt = LambdaFunction ( \"papplyt\" , \"(func, a, b, c) -> callFun(callFun(func, _(), _(), c), a, b)\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus2 , plus3 , papplyt )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ assert ( 6L == sparkSession . sql ( \"select papplyt(plus(_(), _(), _()), 1L, 2L, 3L) as res\" ). as [ Long ]. head ) Here the callFun directly applies the function afterwards but you could equally pass it to other functions. callFun ( callFun ( func , _ (), _ (), c ), a , b ) can then be read as partially apply func (plus with 3 arguments) parameter 3 with the lambda variable c, creating a new two argument function. Then call that function with the a and b parameters. Useless in this case perhaps but it should be illustrative. All that's missing is returning lambdas: val plus2 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b) -> a + b\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val plus3 = LambdaFunction ( \"plus\" , \"(a, b, c) -> plus(plus(a, b), c)\" , Id ( 3 , 2 )) val retLambda = LambdaFunction ( \"retLambda\" , \"(a, b) -> plus(a, b, _())\" , Id ( 2 , 2 )) registerLambdaFunctions ( Seq ( plus2 , plus3 , retLambda )) import sparkSession . implicits . _ assert ( 6L == { val sql = sparkSession . sql ( \"select callFun(retLambda(1L, 2L), 3L) as res\" ) sql . as [ Long ]. head }) here the user function retLambda returns the plus with 3 arity applied over a and b, leaving a function of one arity to fill. The top level callFun then applies the last argument (c). The second test It is experimental Although behaviour has been tested with compilation and across the support DBRs it's entirely possible there are gaps in the trickery used. A good example of the experimental nature is the _() function, it's quite possible that is taken by Spark at a later stage. lambda drop in call arguments to transform_values and transform_keys don't work on 3.0 and 3.1.2 They pattern match on List and not seq, later versions fix this. To work around this you must explicitly use lambdas for these functions.","title":"Higher Order Functions"},{"location":"advanced/userFunctions/#controlling-compilation-tweaking-the-quality-optimisations","text":"Normal Spark LambdaFunctions, NamedLambdaVariable and HigherOrderFunctions aren't compiled, this is - in part - due to the nature of having to thread the lambda variables across the Expression tree and calling bind. At the time of codegen bind has already been called however so the code is free to create a new tree just for compilation. Quality makes use of this and replaces all NamedLambdaVariables expressions with a simple variable in the generated code. NamedLambdaVariables also use AtomicReferences, which was introduced to avoid a tree manipulation task - see here for the code introduction. AtomicReferences are slower for both writes and reads of non-contended variables. As such Quality does away with this in its compilation, the exprId is sufficient to track the actual id. Quality only attempts to replace it's own FunN and reverts to using NamedLambdaVariables if it encounters any other HigherOrderFunction. Where it can replace it uses NamedLambdaVariableCodeGen with an ExprId specific code snippet. You can customise this logic via implementing: trait LambdaCompilationHandler { /** * * @param expr * @return empty if the expression should be transformed (i.e. there is a custom solution for it). Otherwise return the full set of NamedLambdaVariables found */ def shouldTransform ( expr : Expression ): Seq [ NamedLambdaVariable ] /** * Transform the expression using the scope of replaceable named lambda variable expression * @param expr * @param scope * @return */ def transform ( expr : Expression , scope : Map [ ExprId , NamedLambdaVariableCodeGen ]): Expression } and supplying it via the environment variable, System.property or via sparkSession.sparkContext.setLocalProperty quality.lambdaHandlers using this format: name = className where name is either a fully qualified class name of a HigherOrderFunction or of a lambda (FunN) function. The default org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.DoCodegenFallbackHandler allows you to disable any optimisation for a HigherOrderFunction. It can be used to disable all FunN optimisations with: -Dquality.lambdaHandlers=org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.FunN=org.apache.spark.sql.qualityFunctions.DoCodegenFallbackHandler Alternatively if you have a hotspot with any inbuilt HoF such as array_transform, filter or transform_values you could replace the implementation for compilation with your own transformation. e.g.: -Dquality.lambdaHandlers=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.TransformValues=org.mine.SuperfastTransformValues","title":"Controlling compilation - Tweaking the Quality Optimisations"},{"location":"advanced/userFunctions/#why-do-all-this","text":"Speed, it's up to 40% faster.

The field names used follow the convention of the default Product Encoder but can be renamed as desired. Similarly, reading the rules can be as simple as: val rereadWithoutLambdas = readRulesFromDF ( ruleDF , col ( \"ruleSuiteId\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleSetId\" ), col ( \"ruleSetVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleId\" ), col ( \"ruleVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleExpr\" ) ) val reReadLambdas = readLambdasFromDF ( lambdaDF . toDF (), col ( \"name\" ), col ( \"ruleExpr\" ), col ( \"functionId\" ), col ( \"functionVersion\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteId\" ), col ( \"ruleSuiteVersion\" ) ) val reReadRuleSuite = integrateLambdas ( rereadWithoutLambdas , reReadLambdas ) The column names used during reading are not assumed and must be specified. Versioned rule datasets \u00b6 The user is completely free to chose their own version management approach, but the design is aimed at immutability and evidencing.
